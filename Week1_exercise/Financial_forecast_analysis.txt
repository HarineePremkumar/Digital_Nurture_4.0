Analysis:

1. Recursive Forecasting

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursive call stack

Formula:
FutureValue(n) = FutureValue(n - 1) * (1 + growthRate)

Use Case: Conceptual or small inputs

Drawback: Inefficient for large n (stack overflow risk)

2. Iterative Forecasting (Optimized)

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Use Case: Better for large n, avoids stack overflows

Conclusion:

Recursion is helpful to understand the problem but not optimal for large years.

Iterative solution is more practical and memory-efficient.
