Analysis:

1. Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n)

Best Case: O(1) (if the item is found at the beginning)

Worst Case: O(n) (if the item is last or not present)

Use Case: When the product list is small or unsorted.

2. Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n)

Best Case: O(1) (if the item is exactly in the middle)

Worst Case: O(log n)

Requirement: The product list must be sorted.

Use Case: Ideal for large datasets where fast lookup is needed.

Conclusion:

Use Linear Search for simplicity or small unsorted data.

Use Binary Search for large and sorted data for faster performance.
